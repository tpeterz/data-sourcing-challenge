# Background

>You've been tasked to prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. You will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.

# Instructions
This Challenge has three parts, and must be completed in order:

* Part 1: Access the New York Times API.

* Part 2: Access The Movie Database API.

* Part 3: Merge and Clean the Data for Export.

The starter code includes importing the required dependencies and your API keys from your .env file, but you will need to ensure your API keys are added to that file.

# Part 1: Access the New York Times API
1. The base URL is included in the starter code, along with the search string and query dates. Consult the New York Times Article Search API documentationLinks to an external site. to help you build your query_url using these variables.

    * If you accidentally delete these variables, they are:

---
```
# Set the base URL
url = "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?"

# Filter for movie reviews with "love" in the headline
# section_name should be "Movies"
# type_of_material should be "Review"
filter_query = 'section_name:"Movies" AND type_of_material:"Review" AND headline:"love"'

# Use a sort filter, sort by newest
sort = "newest"

# Select the following fields to return:
# headline, web_url, snippet, source, keywords, pub_date, byline, word_count
field_list = "headline,web_url,snippet,source,keywords,pub_date,byline,word_count"

# Search for reviews published between a begin and end date
begin_date = "20130101"
end_date = "20230531"
```
---
2. Create an empty list called reviews_list to store the reviews you retrieve from the API.

3. The Article Search API limits results to 10 per page, but we want to try to retrieve 200. To do this, create a for loop to loop through 20 pages (starting from page 0). Inside the loop, perform the following actions:

* Extend the query_url created in Step 1 to include the page parameter.

* Make a GET request to retrieve the page of results, and store the JSON data in a variable called reviews.

* Add a 12-second interval between queries to stay within API query limits.

**Important:** The New York Times limits requests to 500 per day and 5 per minute.

* Write a try-except clause that performs the following actions:

    * try: loop through the reviews["response"]["docs"] and append each review to the list, then print out the query page number (i.e. the number of times the loop has executed).

    * except: Print the page number that had no results then break from the loop.

* **Note:** If your loop breaks at the except clause, it is possible you have tried to make a request that fell outside of the rate limit. You should be able to loop through all 20 pages with the provided query parameters.

4. Preview the first five results in JSON format using json.dumps with the argument indent=4 to format the data.

5. Convert reviews_list to a Pandas DataFrame using json_normalize()

6. Extract the movie title from the "headline.main" column and save it to a new column "title". To do this, you will use the Pandas apply() method and the following lambda function:

    `lambda st: st[st.find("\u2018")+1:st.find("\u2019 Review")]`

    * This code takes the string in the cell and extracts the characters between the unicode quotation marks, as long as a space and the word "Review" follows the closing quotation mark.

* Use the supplied extract_keywords function to convert the "keywords" column from a list of dictionaries to strings using the apply() method.

* Create a list called titles from the "title" column using to_list(). These titles will be used in the query for The Movie Database.

# Part 2: Access The Movie Database API
Consult the Search & Query for Details documentationLinks to an external site. to build your query URLs. You will be making both types of requests to extract all of the details you need:

* The search query is used to find the movie ID from the search by title. Most of this query is included in your starter code, as follows, but you will need to include the movie title in the query:

```
# Prepare The Movie Database query
url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?query="
tmdb_key_string = "&api_key=" + tmdb_api_key
```

* The movie query is made once you have the movie ID.

You will use the titles list created in Part 1 to perform your queries with The Movie Database.

1. Create an empty list called tmdb_movies_list to store the results from your API requests. This will contain a list of dictionaries.

2. Create a variable called request_counter and initialize it with the value of 1. This counter should do the following:

    * Increment by one every time you iterate through the titles list.

    * Use time.sleep(1) when it reaches a multiple of 50.

    * Print a message to indicate that the application is sleeping.

3. Loop through the titles list created from the movie reviews DataFrame, and perform the following actions:

* Perform the actions outlined in Step 2.

* Perform a GET request that sends the title to The Movie Database search and retrieves the JSON results.

* Use a try clause that performs the following actions:

    * Collect the movie ID from the first result.

    * Make a GET request using the movie query (starting with https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/) and movie ID to retrieve the full movie details in JSON format.

    * Extract the genre names from the results into a list called genres.

    * Extract the spoken_languages' English name from the results into a list called spoken_languages.

    * Extract the production_countries' name from the results into a list called production_countries.

    * Create a dictionary with the following results: title, original_title, budget, original_language, homepage, overview, popularity, runtime, revenue, release_date, vote_average, vote_count, as well as the genres, spoken_languages, and production_countries lists you just created.

    * Append this dictionary to tmdb_movies_list.

    * Print out the name of the movie and a message to indicate that the title was found.

* Use the except clause to print out a statement if a movie is not found.

4. Preview the first five results in JSON format using json.dumps with the argument indent=4 to format the data.

5. Convert the results to a DataFrame called tmdb_df with pd.DataFrame(). You don't need to use json_normalize() this time because we don't have nested objects.

# Part 3: Merge and Clean the Data for Export

Now that you have collected the data from both APIs, you need to merge the two DataFrames and clean the data, then export it for future use.

1. Merge the New York Times reviews and TMDB DataFrames on the title column.

2. The genres, spoken_languages, and production_countries columns were saved as lists, but we want the columns to be strings without the list characters ([, ], and '). To fix these columns, perform the following actions:

    * Create a list of the columns that need fixing called columns_to_fix.

    * Create a list of characters to remove called characters_to_remove.

    * Loop through columns_to_fix and do the following:

        * Use astype() to convert the column to a string.

        * Loop through the characters_to_remove and use the Pandas str.replace() method to remove the character from the string.

* Print the head of the updated DataFrame to confirm the list characters were removed.

3. Delete any duplicate rows and reset the index.

4. Export data to a CSV file without the DataFrame's index
    * This will be located under `Resources/movie_data_pulled.csv`
